👋 Hi there! I'm Illia Ilin - a seasoned engineer, currently diving deep into the world of DevOps culture, with a rich background of over a decade in telecommunications (rooted in Ukraine). Now, I'm exploring new professional landscapes in Ireland 🍀.

Transitioning from a telecom pro to an SRE/DevOps enthusiast wasn't just a shift in the profession — it was a leap towards embracing complex challenges with open arms. My toolkit? A solid command over Kubernetes, Linux, Python, JavaScript, and Bash, combined with a passion for optimizing systems and solving problems that others might shy away from.

But it's not all tech in my world. I'm deeply engaged with social movements and cherish diverse interests, reflecting my belief in the power of community and change. My journey from Ukraine to Ireland, fueled by unforeseen circumstances, has been nothing short of an adventure - one that's taught me resilience, adaptability, and the value of looking forward, no matter what.
